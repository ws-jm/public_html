			<h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>

			<p>Last updated: July 4, 2021</p>
			<p>These terms and conditions, as may be amended from time to time, apply to all our services directly or
				indirectly (through distributors) made available online, through any mobile device, by email or by
				telephone.</p>
			<p>Please read these Terms and Conditions ("Terms", "Terms and Conditions") carefully before using the
				website (the "Service") operated by Sarus Systems Limited ("Sarus", "us", "we", or "our").</p>
			<p>The services offered are for professional users and commercial enterprises only. They are not available
				to private consumers.</p>
			<p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these
				Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who access or use the Service.</p>
			<p>By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of
				the terms then you may not access the Service.</p>
			<p>By accessing, browsing and using our website and/or by purchasing a subscription to our Service, you
				acknowledge and agree to have read, understood and agreed to the terms and conditions set out in this
				document and in the Privacy Policy and Cookies Policy and Copyright notice on the website. If you
				disagree with any part of the terms then you may not access the Service.</p>
			<br>

			<div class="blue-title">Definitions</div>
			<ul>
				<li>"Company" Sarus Systems Limited (and the terms "Sarus", "we", "our" and "us" shall be
					construed accordingly).</li>
				<li>"Service" means all services provided by us and subscribed to by the subscriber.</li>
				<li>"Website" means any website, web service or application through whatever platform owned or operated
					by Sarus.</li>
				<li>"Subscriber" means a professional or individual representing a commercial enterprise who has
					registered and paid to obtain our Services (and the terms "you" and "your" shall be construed
					accordingly).</li>
				<li>"Market Data" means price and trade related data as published by banks, stock exchanges, commodity
					markets and independent market assessment companies. It includes derived data (prices created using
					market data available from the website).</li>
				<li>"Metadata" refers to detailed information about a market data price. It includes but is not limited
					to description, market source, category, vendor, currency, data type, and conversion information.
				</li>
			</ul>


			<div class="blue-title">Subscriptions</div>
			<p>Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in
				advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly
				or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.
			</p>
			<p>At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription(s) will by default renew automatically under the
				exact same conditions unless you cancel it or we cancel it.</p>
			<p>The setting of this automatic subscription renewal feature can be changed through your account control
				panel on our website or when registering your payment method.</p>
			<p>A valid payment method, including credit card or PayPal, is required to process the payment for your
				Subscription. You shall provide us with accurate and complete billing information including full name,
				address, state, zip or post code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By
				submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize us to charge all Subscription fees
				incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.</p>
			<p>Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason or be disabled by the subscriber, we will issue an
				electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the
				full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.</p>
			<p>We may from time to time vary the benefits associated with a subscription. We will give you written
				notice of the variation and providing that, if in our reasonable opinion such a variation results in a
				substantial loss of value or functionality, you shall have the right to cancel your subscription, and we
				will refund to you any amounts paid to us in respect of any period of subscription after the date of
				such cancellation.</p>

			<br>

			<div class="blue-title">Free Trial</div>
			<p>Sarus may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial for a limited period of time
				("Free Trial").</p>
			<p>You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign up for the Free Trial.</p>
			<p>At any time and without notice, we reserve the right to (i) modify the terms and conditions of the Free
				Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.</p>
			<br>

			<div class="blue-title">Fee Changes</div>
			<p>Sarus, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the subscription fees for the subscriptions.
				Any
				subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current billing cycle.</p>
			<p>Sarus Limited will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in subscription fees to give
				you an opportunity to terminate your subscription before such change becomes effective.</p>
			<p>Your continued use of the Service after the subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your
				agreement to pay the modified subscription fee amount.</p>
			<br>
			<div class="blue-title">Refunds</div>
			<p>Except when required by law, paid Subscription fees are non-refundable.</p>
			<br>

			<div class="blue-title">Content</div>
			<p>Our Service may allow you to post, link, store, share and otherwise make available certain information,
				text, graphics, videos, or other material ("Content"). You are responsible for the content that you post
				to the Service, including its legality, reliability, and appropriateness.</p>
			<p>By posting content to the Service, you grant us the right and license to use, modify, publicly perform,
				publicly display, reproduce, and distribute such content on and through the Service. You retain any and
				all of your rights to any content you submit, post or display on or through the Service and you are
				responsible for protecting those rights. You agree that this license includes the right for us to make
				your content available to other users of the Service, who may also use your content subject to these
				Terms.</p>
			<p>You represent and warrant that: (i) the content is yours (you own it) or you have the right to use it and
				grant us the rights and license as provided in these Terms, and (ii) the posting of your content on or
				through the Service does not violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract rights

			<br>

			<div class="blue-title">Accounts</div>
			<p>When you create an account with us, you must provide us information that is accurate, complete, and
				current at all times. Failure to do so constitutes a breach of the Terms, which may result in immediate
				termination of your account on our Service.</p>
			<p>You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Service and for any
				activities or actions under your password, whether your password is with our Service or a third-party
				service.</p>
